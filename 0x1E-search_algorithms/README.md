# Search Algorithms Project

## Introduction

This project is focused on understanding and implementing search algorithms in the C programming language. The primary goal is to gain knowledge about different search algorithms, their characteristics, and when to use them based on specific needs.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this project, you should be able to:

- Explain what a search algorithm is.
- Understand the concepts of linear search and binary search.
- Determine the best search algorithm to use based on specific requirements.
