Variadic Functions Project
Learning Objectives
In this project, we will explore variadic functions, stdarg.h library, the use of const type qualifier, and understanding how to work with variable argument lists in C.

General
Understand what variadic functions are and when to use them.
Learn to use the va_start, va_arg, and va_end macros for handling variable argument lists.
Explore the purpose and usage of the const type qualifier in C.
Project Overview
In this project, we will be implementing a set of functions using variadic functions and stdarg.h library in C. These functions will take a variable number of arguments and perform specific tasks. We will strictly adhere to the project requirements and ensure our code follows the Betty style.
