## Introduction

A hash table is a data structure that allows for efficient data retrieval by mapping keys to values. This project will introduce you to the concepts of hash tables, hash functions, and how to handle collisions.

## Project Objectives

By the end of this project, you will be able to explain to anyone:

### General
- What is a hash function?
- What makes a good hash function?
- What is a hash table, how do they work, and how to use them?
- What is a collision, and what are the main ways of dealing with collisions in the context of a hash table?
- What are the advantages and drawbacks of using hash tables?
- What are the most common use cases of hash tables?

### Copyright - Plagiarism
- Understand that plagiarism is strictly forbidden.

## Getting Started

## Project Requirements
## Usage

Explain how to use your project, how to compile the code, and provide examples if necessary.

## Learning Objectives

At the end of this project, you should be able to explain the concepts of hash tables, hash functions, collisions, and their use cases without relying on external resources like Google.

## Resources

Read or watch the following resources to gain a better understanding of hash tables:

- [What is a HashTable Data Structure - Introduction to Hash Tables](https://example.com)
- [Hash function](https://example.com)
- [Hash table](https://example.com)
- [All about hash tables](https://example.com)
- [Why hash tables and not arrays](https://example.com)

## Tests

We strongly encourage working together on a set of tests to ensure your implementation is correct. You can also draw inspiration from Python dictionaries, which are implemented using hash tables.
