0x0A. C - argc, argv
This repository contains the solutions to the tasks of the "0x0A. C - argc, argv" project, which is part of the ALX programming curriculum.

Description
In this project, we explore the usage of command line arguments (argc and argv) in C programming. We learn how to access and manipulate command line arguments passed to our programs. Additionally, we discuss the two prototypes of main and their appropriate use. We also cover techniques to compile functions with unused variables or parameters using __attribute__((unused)) or (void).

Learning Objectives
By the end of this project, we aim to achieve the following learning objectives:

Understanding how to use arguments passed to a C program.
Familiarity with the concepts of argc and argv.
Knowing the two prototypes of main and when to use each.
Learning how to compile functions with unused variables or parameters using __attribute__((unused)) or (void).
