# Project Title: Makefiles in C

## Introduction
This project focuses on learning and implementing Makefiles in the C programming language. The tasks involve creating a simple Makefile to compile a C program.

## Tasks
### Task 0: Creating the First Makefile
- **Makefile**: The Makefile contains a rule named 'all' that builds the 'school' executable using the GCC compiler.

# Clean rule to remove the executable

# General Learning Objectives

Understand the concepts of make and Makefiles.
Know when, why, and how to use Makefiles.
Define and use rules in Makefiles.
Differentiate between explicit and implicit rules.
Identify common and useful rules in Makefiles.
Work with variables in Makefiles.
