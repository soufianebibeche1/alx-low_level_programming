Recursion
This project focuses on understanding recursion, implementing recursive functions, and understanding the situations where recursion is appropriate or not.

What is Recursion?
Recursion is a programming technique in which a function calls itself to solve a smaller instance of the same problem. It involves breaking down a complex problem into smaller, more manageable subproblems, and solving them recursively until a base case is reached.

A recursive function consists of two parts:

Base Case: It defines the simplest version of the problem that can be solved directly without further recursion.
Recursive Case: It defines how the problem is broken down into smaller subproblems and calls the function itself to solve them.
Recursion is based on the principle of mathematical induction, where we prove that a statement is true for a base case and then show that if it is true for any case, it must be true for the next case as well.

How to Implement Recursion
To implement recursion, you need to define a function that calls itself within its body. Here's a general structure of a recursive function:

Situations to Use Recursion
Recursion is often useful in solving problems that exhibit the following characteristics:
Divide and Conquer: When a problem can be divided into smaller, similar subproblems, and the solution to the larger problem can be constructed from the solutions of the subproblems.
Tree-like Structure: When the problem can be represented using a hierarchical or tree-like structure, and the solution involves traversing or manipulating the structure.
Backtracking: When exploring all possible paths or combinations to find a solution, such as in maze solving, permutation generation, or solving puzzles.
Recursive Data Structures: When working with recursive data structures like linked lists, trees, or graphs, where recursion naturally simplifies the operations.
Mathematical Induction: When solving problems that can be proven by mathematical induction, where the solution for a larger case depends on the solution of a smaller case.

Situations to Avoid Recursion
Recursion may not be suitable or efficient in certain situations:
Performance Impact: Recursive solutions can be less efficient than iterative solutions due to the overhead of function calls and maintaining function call stack.
Stack Overflow: Recursive functions that require a large number of recursive calls or have deep recursion depth can cause stack overflow errors if the system's stack size is exceeded.
Complexity: Some problems may be inherently difficult to solve using recursion or may require additional state management that is more straightforward with iteration.
Resource Consumption: Recursive functions can consume more system resources (memory) compared to iterative solutions, as each recursive call requires additional stack space.
