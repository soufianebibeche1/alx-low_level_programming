Singly Linked Lists Project
This project focuses on implementing and utilizing singly linked lists in C programming language. It aims to improve your understanding of data structures, particularly linked lists, and their applications. By the end of this project, you should be able to explain the advantages of using linked lists over arrays and demonstrate how to build and use linked lists effectively.

Learning Objectives
Understand when and why to use linked lists over arrays.
Implement and manage singly linked lists in C.
Gain proficiency in using dynamic memory allocation (malloc and free).
Adhere to coding style guidelines using the Betty style.
ected to work on the following tasks to achieve the learning objectives:

Implement a function to create a new node for the singly linked list.
Write a function to insert a new node at the beginning of the linked list.
Create a function to insert a new node at the end of the linked list.
Implement a function to free all memory used by the linked list.
Write a function to print all elements of the linked list.
