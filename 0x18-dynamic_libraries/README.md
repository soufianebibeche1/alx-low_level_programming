# Dynamic Libraries in C - Project README

## Introduction

This project is part of the ALX Software Engineering Program and focuses on dynamic libraries in the C programming language. The objective of this project is to gain a deep understanding of dynamic libraries, how they work, how to create them, and how to use them in Linux. Additionally, you will learn about environment variables like `$LD_LIBRARY_PATH` and the differences between static and shared libraries. You will also explore basic commands such as `nm`, `ldd`, and `ldconfig`.

By the end of this project, you will be able to explain to others, without external assistance:

1. What is a dynamic library, how it works, how to create one, and how to use it.
2. The purpose of the environment variable `$LD_LIBRARY_PATH` and how to use it.
3. The differences between static and shared libraries.
4. Basic usage of commands like `nm`, `ldd`, and `ldconfig.

## Requirements

### Programming (C Language)

- You should write C code using editors like `vi`, `vim`, or `emacs`.
- The code should be compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using the GCC compiler with specific options: `-Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic -std=gnu89`.
- Ensure your code follows the Betty style, and it will be checked using `betty-style.pl` and `betty-doc.pl`.
- No global variables are allowed.
- Each C file should contain no more than five functions.
- You cannot use standard library functions like `printf`, `puts`, etc., except for `_putchar`.

### Bash Scripts

- Write Bash scripts that will be tested on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS.
- All scripts should be executable and have a shebang as the first line (`#!/bin/bash`).
- Include a `README.md` file at the root of the project folder to describe the purpose of each script.
- Make sure all script files end with a newline character.

## Conclusion

This project will provide you with a solid foundation in working with dynamic libraries in C and understanding key Linux concepts related to libraries and environment variables. Completing this project will help you develop a deeper understanding of C programming and system administration on Linux. Good luck with your learning and coding journey!
