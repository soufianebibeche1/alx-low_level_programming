Project: Pointers, Multidimensional Arrays, and String Manipulation
This project focuses on understanding and applying concepts related to pointers, multidimensional arrays, and string manipulation in the C programming language.

Learning Objectives
By completing this project, you will gain a solid understanding of the following topics without relying on external resources:

Pointers to Pointers:

Definition and usage of pointers to pointers.
How to declare, initialize, and dereference pointers to pointers.
Understanding the concept of double indirection.
Multidimensional Arrays:

Understanding the concept of multidimensional arrays.
Creating and manipulating arrays with multiple dimensions.
Accessing and modifying elements in multidimensional arrays.
String Manipulation Functions


Examples
In the examples directory, you will find sample main.c files that demonstrate how to use the implemented functions. These examples can be used for testing and validation purposes.

Remember to test your code thoroughly and consider edge cases to ensure the correctness of your functions.
