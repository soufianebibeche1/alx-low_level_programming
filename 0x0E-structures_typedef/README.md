Project: C - Structures, typedef
This project focuses on understanding and implementing structures and typedef in the C programming language. It covers the usage, benefits, and syntax of structures, as well as how to use typedef to create custom data types. By completing the project, you will gain a solid understanding of these concepts and be able to explain them without relying on external resources.

Learning Objectives
By the end of this project, you should be able to:

Explain what structures are and when to use them
Understand the purpose and usage of typedef in C
Create and manipulate structures in C
Use typedef to define custom data types
Write code that follows the Betty style and meets the project requirements
Requirements
Allowed editors: vi, vim, emacs
All files will be compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using gcc with the following flags: -Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic -std=gnu89
All files should end with a new line
Your code should use the Betty style. You can check it using betty-style.pl and betty-doc.pl
Do not use global variables
Limit each file to a maximum of 5 functions
The only C standard library functions allowed are printf, malloc, free, and exit
Tasks
The project consists of several tasks that require you to apply your understanding of structures and typedef. The specific requirements for each task can be found in the project resources.

Repository Contents
The project repository should contain the following files:
