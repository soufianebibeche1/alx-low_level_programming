## Project Description

A doubly linked list is a data structure that consists of nodes, where each node contains a data element and two pointers. One pointer points to the previous node in the list, and the other points to the next node, making it possible to traverse the list in both directions. This project aims to teach you how to understand, implement, and use doubly linked lists, including common operations like insertion and deletion.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this project, you are expected to:

- Understand what a doubly linked list is and how it works.
- Implement and use various operations on doubly linked lists, such as insertion and deletion.
- Start developing the ability to find the right sources of information and solve problems independently.
