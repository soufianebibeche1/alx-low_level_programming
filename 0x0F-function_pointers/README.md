Function Pointers in C
This project explores the concept of function pointers in the C programming language. Function pointers are a powerful feature that allows us to store the address of functions and call them indirectly. They provide a way to create more flexible and dynamic code by enabling runtime function selection.

Learning Objectives
By the end of this project, we aim to understand the following concepts without relying on external sources:

What are function pointers and how to use them.
What does a function pointer exactly hold.
Where does a function pointer point to in the virtual memory.

Tasks
This project consists of several tasks that require understanding and implementation of function pointers. The tasks will help us explore the various aspects of using function pointers in C.
