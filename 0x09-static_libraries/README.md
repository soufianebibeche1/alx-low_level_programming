# C Static Libraries Project

This project focuses on understanding and working with C static libraries. It covers topics such as creating static libraries, using them in programs, and basic usage of relevant commands like `ar`, `ranlib`, and `nm`.

## Description

In this project, we explore the concept of C static libraries and their usage. We will understand what static libraries are, how they work, and learn how to create and use them in C programs. Additionally, we'll familiarize ourselves with commands such as `ar`, `ranlib`, and `nm` that are used in the process.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this project, you should be able to:

- Explain what a static library is, how it works, and its benefits.
- Create a static library using the `ar` and `ranlib` commands.
- Understand the process of using a static library in a C program.
- Utilize basic commands such as `ar`, `ranlib`, and `nm`.
